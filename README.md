## 📡 Tunilo — Simple, Extremely Fast Reverse Tunnel for Exposing Local Services

Tunio is a lightweight **Reverse Tunnel** that lets you expose a local HTTP service to the public internet through a TCP control channel.

It works similarly to ngrok, cloudflare tunnel, and localtunnel, but is intentionally minimal and easy to extend.

> The difference this project makes besides minimalism is that the public facing server is yours, basically making it a **self-hosted reverse-tunnel**.
